What is the general term for speech gestures using the lips?,Labial articulations
What is the general term for speech gestures using the tip or blade of the tongue?,Coronal articulations
What is the general term for speech gestures using the back of the tongue?,Dorsal articulations
What is a bilabial place of articulation?,A sound made with both lips.
What is a labiodental place of articulation?,A sound made with the lower lip and upper front teeth.
What is a dental place of articulation?,A sound made with the tongue tip or blade and the upper front teeth.
What is an interdental sound?,A dental sound where the tongue protrudes between the upper and lower teeth.

What is a velar place of articulation?,A sound made with the back of the tongue and the soft palate.
"In the context of the oro-nasal process, how is a nasal sound produced?","The soft palate is lowered, allowing air to escape through the nose."
Manner: Oral Stop (Plosive),"Definition: Complete closure of the articulators in the mouth with the soft palate raised, resulting in a burst of air upon release."
Manner: Nasal Stop,"Definition: Complete closure in the oral cavity while the soft palate is lowered, allowing air to flow through the nose."
Manner: Fricative,Definition: Close approximation of two articulators causing turbulent airflow and a hissing sound.
What is a sibilant?,"A higher-pitched fricative sound with a more obvious hiss, such as [s] or [sh]."
Manner: Approximant,Definition: One articulator is close to another without narrowing the vocal tract enough to produce turbulent airflow.
Manner: Lateral (Approximant),"Definition: Obstruction of the airstream at the center of the oral tract, while air flows freely over the side(s) of the tongue."
What is an affricate?,A sound combining a stop closure immediately followed by a fricative at the same place of articulation.
What is a tap (or flap)?,"A manner of articulation where the tongue makes a single, rapid contact against the alveolar ridge."
What are the three primary factors used to describe vowel targets?,"Tongue height, front-back tongue position, and degree of lip rounding."
Vowels where the highest point of the tongue is in the front of the mouth are called _____.,Front vowels
Vowels where the tongue is close to the back surface of the vocal tract are called _____.,Back vowels
The vowel in 'heed' is classified by height as a _____ vowel.,High (front)
The vowel in 'had' is classified by height as a _____ vowel.,Low (front)
What are the two possible states for lip gestures during vowel production?,Rounded and unrounded.
What are the characteristic overtone pitches of vowels called?,Formants
Which vowel formant is the lower-pitched one and is distinguishable in a creaky voice?,The first formant ($F_1$).
Which vowel formant is the higher-pitched one and corresponds roughly to front-back tongue position?,The second formant ($F_2$).
The first formant ($F_1$) is related inversely to which articulatory parameter?,Vowel height (lower $F_1$ means higher tongue position).
"What term refers to features superimposed on syllables, such as stress, pitch, and length?",Suprasegmentals
