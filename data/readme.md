This semester, I expect to learn how applied English linguistics connects to real classroom practice
rather than remaining as abstract theories or textbook knowledge.

Through this course, I hope to understand how linguistic concepts such as language use, meaning,
and learner interaction can be translated into concrete teaching activities
that support English learners more effectively.

I am particularly interested in learning the basics of coding,
even though I have no prior experience with programming.
I expect this course to help me overcome my fear of technology
and see coding as a tool for teaching rather than a technical skill for specialists.

By learning how to design simple class applications,
I hope to gain hands-on experience in creating learning materials
that respond to students’ needs instead of relying only on ready-made tools.
I expect that building my own apps will help me think more creatively
about lesson design and classroom interaction.

Another important expectation is learning how to create a digital classroom using Streamlit.
I hope to understand how a digital space can organize learning resources,
support student practice, and encourage self-directed learning.
Through this process, I want to experience how teachers can become designers
of learning environments rather than passive users of platforms.

Overall, I expect this course to change how I view applied English linguistics.
Instead of seeing it as a theoretical field,
I hope to recognize it as a practical foundation for teaching,
digital literacy, and pedagogical decision-making.
By the end of the semester, I want to feel more confident
in combining linguistic knowledge, technology, and teaching creativity
as a future English educator.
