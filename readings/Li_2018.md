Translanguaging as a Practical Theory of Language

1. Purpose of the Article

This article argues that translanguaging should be understood not merely as a pedagogical practice, but as a practical theory of language.
Li Wei addresses a long-standing concern in Applied Linguistics: that the field often prioritizes practice over theory and lacks strong theoretical contributions.

The paper proposes translanguaging as a framework that connects real-world language practices with broader theories of language, cognition, and society.

2. What Is Translanguaging?

Translanguaging refers to the use of a speaker’s full linguistic repertoire as an integrated system, rather than the alternation between separate, named languages (e.g., “English” and “Korean”).

Key points:

Languages are not treated as autonomous, bounded systems

Meaning-making is central, not language boundaries

Translanguaging goes beyond traditional notions of code-switching or code-mixing

3. Why Translanguaging Matters in Applied Linguistics

Li Wei argues that translanguaging helps Applied Linguistics to:

Better account for actual language use in multilingual societies

Move away from monolingual and native-speaker norms

Develop theory from practice, rather than applying theory to practice

In this sense, translanguaging aligns with Applied Linguistics as a problem-driven and socially grounded discipline.

4. Translanguaging as a Theory (Not Just a Practice)

The article positions translanguaging as a practical theory of language, meaning that it:

Emerges from real communicative practices

Explains how language, cognition, and social interaction are intertwined

Feeds back into theoretical understandings of language

Translanguaging is therefore both:

Descriptive (explaining what multilingual speakers do)

Theoretical (reconceptualizing what language is)

5. Key Theoretical Contributions
(1) Language and Thought

Translanguaging challenges the idea that thinking is tied to a single language system.
Instead, cognition draws on multiple semiotic and linguistic resources simultaneously.

(2) Modularity of Mind

The paper questions strict separations between linguistic, cognitive, and social modules, proposing a more integrated view of human communication.

6. Two Core Concepts
Translanguaging Space

A dynamic social and interactional space

Where multilingual speakers bring together linguistic, cultural, and experiential resources

Enables creativity, identity negotiation, and meaning-making

Translanguaging Instinct

The natural tendency of humans to mobilize all available communicative resources

Suggests that translanguaging is not exceptional, but fundamental to human communication

7. Implications for Education and Research

Translanguaging legitimizes the use of students’ entire linguistic repertoires in learning

It reframes multilingualism as a resource, not a problem

It provides a theoretical foundation for inclusive, equitable language education

8. Key Takeaways

Translanguaging is more than code-switching; it is an integrated theory of language use

It bridges practice and theory in Applied Linguistics

It offers a powerful lens for understanding multilingual communication in contemporary societies
