# Applied Linguistics (Spring 2026): Streamlit-Based App Design for Teacher Graduate Students  
*A One-Semester Learning Flow*

This course is designed for **graduate students in English education and teacher education** who have **no prior coding experience**.  
Over one semester, students learn how to **deploy Streamlit apps** and **design their own pedagogically meaningful tools** for classroom use.

The goal is **not** to train programmers, but to support teachers in becoming **confident designers of digital instructional tools**.

## Overall Learning Trajectory (At a Glance)

**User → Adapter → Designer → Builder → Deployer → Reflective Practitioner**

---

## Phase 1. Reframing the Role of Technology  
**Weeks 1–2 | From Tool User to Educational Designer**

### What students learn
- A shift in mindset: apps are not “for developers only”
- Educational apps as *pedagogical design artifacts*

### Key activities
- Exploring existing educational apps and identifying limitations
- Discussing classroom situations where “a small custom app” would help
- Interacting with sample Streamlit apps (buttons, inputs, outputs)

### Learning outcome
- Students can articulate **a concrete educational need** that could be addressed with a simple app

---

## Phase 2. Minimal Coding Literacy (Reading, Not Writing)  
**Weeks 3–4 | Understanding Code Without Fear**

### What students learn
- Code as *readable instructions*, not abstract mathematics
- Python as a descriptive, human-readable language

### Key activities
- Understanding variables, lists, and functions conceptually
- Reading Streamlit code:
  - `st.button()`
  - `st.text_input()`
  - `st.selectbox()`
- “What happens if this line is removed?” experiments

### Learning outcome
- Students can **interpret the structure** of a simple app
- Anxiety around code is significantly reduced

---

## Phase 3. Understanding App Structure  
**Weeks 5–6 | Input – Processing – Output Thinking**

### What students learn
- All educational apps follow an **Input → Process → Output** logic
- Pedagogical questions determine app structure

### Key activities
- Deconstructing quiz apps, vocabulary trainers, slide viewers
- Learning Streamlit layout concepts:
  - columns
  - tabs
  - sidebar
- Intuitive understanding of “state” (the app remembers user actions)

### Learning outcome
- Students can explain **how a classroom activity maps onto an app structure**

---

## Phase 4. Adapting and Remixing Existing Apps  
**Weeks 7–9 | Modification Instead of Creation from Scratch**

### What students learn
- Educational app design as **adaptation and recombination**
- Teachers do not need to write everything themselves

### Key activities
- Modifying provided templates:
  - changing questions
  - replacing datasets (CSV)
  - adjusting feedback logic
- Uploading materials to GitHub
- Loading external data into Streamlit apps

### Learning outcome
- Students successfully run a **customized app tailored to their own teaching context**

---

## Phase 5. Deployment Experience  
**Weeks 10–11 | From Local File to Live Teaching Tool**

### What students learn
- An app is a **shareable learning environment**, not just a local script
- Deployment as a pedagogical act of sharing

### Key activities
- Understanding basic GitHub repository structure
- Deploying apps on Streamlit Cloud
- Testing apps from a student’s perspective via shared URLs

### Learning outcome
- Students can **share a live app link** usable in real classrooms

---

## Phase 6. Integrating Apps into Lesson Design  
**Weeks 12–13 | Apps as Part of Pedagogical Flow**

### What students learn
- Apps support instruction, they do not replace it
- The importance of timing, purpose, and learner role

### Key activities
- Designing lesson flows (pre-task, during-task, post-task)
- Predicting learner interaction with apps
- Adding simple feedback or evaluation components

### Learning outcome
- Students can explain **why, when, and how** an app is used in a lesson

---

## Phase 7. Reflection and Teacher Identity Development  
**Weeks 14–15 | Becoming a Confident Digital Educator**

### What students learn
- Technical mastery is secondary to pedagogical agency
- Reflection as part of professional growth

### Key activities
- Reflective writing on the design process
- Comparing beliefs before and after the course
- Discussing future classroom applications

### Learning outcome
- Students identify themselves as **teachers who can design tools**, not just consume them
