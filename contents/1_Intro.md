# Applied Linguistics: From Foundations to the AI Era

## What Is Applied Linguistics?

Applied Linguistics is a problem-oriented field that studies how language works in real-world contexts, especially where language intersects with education, society, technology, and power. Rather than applying linguistic theory mechanically, the field develops theory from practice.

## 1. Early Foundations (1950s–1980s): Language Teaching Focus

Applied Linguistics first emerged to address practical issues in:

+ Second and foreign language teaching

+ Curriculum design and assessment

+ Error analysis and contrastive analysis

**View of language:**
Language as a structured system; learners measured against native-speaker norms.

**Key ideas:**
Accuracy, correctness, transfer, errors.

## 2. The Social Turn (1990s): Language as Social Practice

In the 1990s, researchers began emphasizing:

+ Context, identity, and power

+ Discourse and interaction

+ Sociocultural perspectives on learning

**View of language:**
Language as social action embedded in communities and institutions.

**Key shift:**
From “How is language learned?” → “How is language used, valued, and controlled?”

## 3. Multilingualism & Translanguaging (2000s–2010s)

With globalization and migration, Applied Linguistics questioned:

+ Fixed language boundaries

+ Monolingual ideologies

+ Native vs. non-native speaker divisions

**Key concept:** _Translanguaging_
Multilingual speakers use their entire linguistic repertoire as an integrated system, rather than switching between separate languages.

**Educational implication:**
Learners’ existing languages are resources, not obstacles.

## 4. The Digital Turn (2010s): Language in Online Spaces

The rise of digital communication shifted attention to:

+ Online discourse and social media

+ Multimodal communication (text, image, audio)

+ Digital literacies and participation

**View of language:**
Language as multimodal, interactive, and technologically mediated.

## 5. The AI Era (2020s– ): Language with Intelligent Systems

Generative AI introduces a new phase where language is:

+ Produced, reshaped, and standardized by machines

+ Co-constructed by humans and AI systems

**Key concerns in Applied Linguistics today:**

+ Authorship and agency

+ Bias and inequality in language models

+ Standardization vs. linguistic diversity

+ Critical AI literacy

**Crucial shift:**
AI is not just a tool, but a new participant in language practices.

## Where We Are Now

Today, Applied Linguistics is:

+ Interdisciplinary

+ Socially accountable

+ Critically engaged with technology

+ Focused on meaning, equity, and human agency

**In the AI era, the field asks:**

Not only how language works, but how language, technology, and values interact.
