# Applied Linguistics History and Definitions
**Chapter One Handout Summary**

Davies, Alan (2007) _An Introduction to Applied Linguistics (2nd edition)_. Edinburgh University Press

## 1 Why Is Applied Linguistics Hard to Define

Applied linguistics does not have a single fixed definition. Scholars have long noted that applied linguistics means different things to different people. This lack of consensus reflects the nature of the field rather than a weakness.

**Main reasons for definitional difficulty**
+ Disagreement over what is being applied
+ Ongoing tension between theory and practice
+ Continuous expansion into interdisciplinary domains

## 2 Competing Views of Applied Linguistics

### Mediation View

Applied linguistics is viewed as a mediating discipline between linguistic theory and real world language problems.

+ Associated with scholars such as Kaplan Widdowson and Cook
+ Emphasizes applying linguistic knowledge to practical decision making
+ Treats theory and practice as closely connected

### Ostensive Descriptive View

Applied linguistics is defined by what applied linguists actually do rather than by an abstract definition.

+ Often described as a look around you approach
+ The field consists of loosely connected subdisciplines
+ Emphasizes practice over strict conceptual boundaries

### Critical Applied Linguistics

This perspective foregrounds the political and ideological dimensions of language use.

+ Focuses on power inequality and identity
+ Examines how language maintains or challenges social structures
+ Closely associated with critical discourse traditions

## 3 Source vs Target What Is Being Applied

A central debate concerns whether applied linguistics should be defined by its source or its target.

+ Source refers to linguistics as the primary theoretical input
+ Target refers to the real world language problems being addressed

The chapter argues that defining applied linguistics by its target problems is more productive. Applied linguistics is not simply about applying linguistic theory but about responding to language related issues in social contexts.

## 4 Language Teaching as the Core Target

Historically applied linguistics emerged in response to the need for language teaching expertise especially after World War Two.

**Key points**
+ Language teaching remains the largest professional domain connected to applied linguistics
+ Core areas such as second language acquisition assessment and materials design originate here
+ Other domains developed outward from this central concern

## 5 Expansion Beyond Language Teaching

Over time applied linguistics expanded to include many additional areas.

+ Sociolinguistics
+ Discourse and pragmatics
+ Language policy and planning
+ Translation and interpreting
+ Corpus linguistics
+ Professional and institutional language use

This expansion raised concerns about applied linguistics becoming a science of everything and led to renewed discussions about conceptual coherence.

## 6 Applied Linguistics as an Applied Discipline

Applied linguistics shares characteristics with other applied fields.

+ Focuses on practical human problems
+ Draws on multiple disciplines such as education sociology and psychology
+ Accepts that solutions are local provisional and context dependent

There are no final answers only informed responses to recurring language problems.

## 7 A Provocative Conclusion

The chapter concludes with the idea that all linguistic study may ultimately be applied linguistics.

+ Applied linguistics drives questions
+ Linguistics responds by theorizing and idealizing
+ Theory and practice are inseparable rather than hierarchical

## Key Takeaway

Applied linguistics is best understood as a problem oriented interdisciplinary field committed to understanding and improving how language functions in real world contexts.
